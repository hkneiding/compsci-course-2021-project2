# CompSci Course 2021 - Project 2: Image Recognition using Neural Networks and Gradient Boosting

Repository for the second project in the CompSci PhD program.

Here we explore different methods for image recognition on the benchmark dataset Fashion-MNIST. The methods we are investigating are Concolutional Neural Networks, (Convolutional) Autoencoders in conjunction with regular Multi-Layer Perceptrons, and Boosting using trees.
